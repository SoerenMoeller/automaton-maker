# AutomatonMaker 

This tool can be used to plot an automaton in the format that TI/FM introduced.
In general, NFAs, DFAs and TMs should be supported. 
The functionality for labels could be added, to support LTS's.

## Current state
- No labels on nodes yet
- arrows my have some offset
- no input system yet
- may add support for multiple textlines (edge labels)
- may add text offset to self nodes

## Hot features to come
- Convert the automaton into LaTeX-Code
- Convert the automaton into img-File

## Usage
- Click: Select a node
- a: Create a node
- s: Make selected node a starting node
- e: Make selected node an ending node
- Del/Back: Remove a selected node
- Esc: Unselect
