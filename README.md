# AutomatonMaker 

This tool can be used to plot an automaton in the format that TI/FM introduced.
In general, NFAs, DFAs and TMs should be supported. 
The functionality for labels could be added, to support LTS's.

## Current state
- No arrowheads yet
- No labels on nodes/paths yet
- only straight paths possible yet
- Moving of the start-arrows is not possible yet

## Hot features to come
1. Convert the automaton into LaTeX-Code
